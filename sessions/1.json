            "body": "Based on the provided research, a neural network is a computational learning system inspired by the human brain, designed to process and translate data inputs into desired outputs through a network of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons. Defining a neural network neuron-by-neuron involves specifying the individual components and their interactions for each basic processing unit within the network.\n\n### How to Define a Neural Network Neuron-by-Neuron\n\nTo define a neural network neuron-by-neuron, you would specify the following for each individual artificial neuron:\n\n*   **Inputs:** Each neuron receives one or more inputs. These can be raw data from the initial dataset (for neurons in the input layer) or outputs from other neurons in preceding layers (for neurons in hidden or output layers).\n*   **Weights:** Associated with each input connection is a numerical **weight** ($w$). This weight determines the strength or importance of that particular input. When an input ($x$) is received, it is multiplied by its corresponding weight ($w \\cdot x$).\n*   **Weighted Sum:** The neuron calculates a sum of all its weighted inputs. For a neuron with $n$ inputs, this sum can be represented as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i$.\n*   **Bias:** A **bias** ($b$) term is added to the weighted sum. The bias allows the neuron to adjust its activation threshold and can be seen as an additional input with a constant value of 1.0, connected by a weight equal to the bias value. The linear transformation within the neuron is thus $z = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b$.\n*   **Activation Function:** The result of this linear transformation ($z$) is then passed through an **activation function** (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh). This non-linear function determines the neuron's output, deciding whether and how strongly the neuron \"fires\" or activates. Activation functions are crucial for enabling neural networks to learn complex, non-linear patterns.\n*   **Output:** The value produced by the activation function is the neuron's output. This output can then serve as an input to other neurons in subsequent layers or as part of the overall network's final output.\n*   **Connectivity:** Explicitly defining which neurons connect to which other neurons is a core part of the neuron-by-neuron definition. This allows for customized architectures, including sparse connections where certain links between neurons might be intentionally absent (e.g., by setting their corresponding weights to zero) rather than a fully-connected structure. The research notes the challenge of handling random connectivity and avoiding \"loops\" in such a custom setup.\n\nIn summary, defining a neural network neuron-by-neuron entails meticulously specifying each neuron's inputs, the weights on those inputs, its bias, the chosen activation function, and its output connections to other neurons. This granular control allows for the creation of intricate and specialized network architectures.\n\n### Summary\n\nNeural networks are computational models that mimic the human brain, built from interconnected nodes called neurons. Each neuron processes data by calculating a weighted sum of its inputs, adding a bias, and then passing the result through a non-linear activation function to produce an output. This output can then feed into other neurons. The network learns by iteratively adjusting these weights and biases through processes like forward and backward propagation to minimize errors. Various specialized architectures exist, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data. Defining a network neuron-by-neuron means having fine-grained control over each neuron's parameters (weights, biases, activation function) and its specific connections within the network, enabling custom or sparse designs.\n\n### Research Papers\n\n1.  **machine learning - How to define neural network neuron-by-neuron? - Stack Overflow**\n    *   URL: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64515718/how-to-define-neural-network-neuron-by-neuron`\n2.  **Neural Network Definition | DeepAI**\n    *   URL: `https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/neural-network`\n3.  **Neural Networks Explained: The Brains Behind Deep Learning**\n    *   URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/neural-networks-explained-brains-behind-deep-learning-r8m9c`\n4.  **What is a Neural Network? - GeeksforGeeks**\n    *   URL: `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/neural-networks-a-beginners-guide/`",
